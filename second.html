            A thing that I wanted to ask from the start of this website, was that
            Can I be your prom date. Ultimately its not up to me to make this decision, but yours.
            I know that i'm not the best person and that there are other people better than me out there but thank you for always choosing me no matter what,
            and I just want to apologize if I come off as rude sometimes and that I make you sad or angry.
            I just want to let you know that no matter your decision for this is that I'll respect it no matter what
            since It is your decision. I love you my love.

            Hey Abby, i know you like handwritten letter more than this so I apologize in advance.
            I just want to say that you're very awesome and that you're really pretty, I hope that
            we never break apart and that we never give up on each other no matter what happens.
            Another thing is that if it wasn't for you I would be a worse person compared to who I am now,
            you singlehandledly motivated me to do better. I know this sounds fake or cringe to you but yeah,
            I'm sorry for that and because im not that good with words.
        </p>
